Rental Managment Made Easy.

The major backend components of this web-based applications are:

- Predicitng the values of real-estate properties using Deep Neural Nets
- Reading bank statements and classifying textual information (merchant names) with multinomial naive bayes algorithm into useful categories such as pest control, home repair, rent, utilities.

These information are incorporated into the web application where users will manage different rental properties with DNN-estimated worth, assess the cost breakdown from automatic classification of rental business categories from bank statement (business account), and visualize the sum totals for each category.
